    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ham and cheese omelette is quick, easy, and most importantly, delicious! You can enjoy omelettes with a filling of any breakfast foods you want, but my favorite is this mixture of ham and cheese. It's a great breakfast option or can be used as a quick and easy dinner. Serve with a side of bacon for the best results!</p>
